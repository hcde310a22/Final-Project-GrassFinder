# Final-Project-GrassFinder
This is the Final Project for me (Kulbir Singh) and Hari Rathnam. The Grass Finder project is a product suggestion application that suggests users a product to buy based on the emotions displayed through their day.

For an API Key, please go to https://apilayer.com/marketplace/text_to_emotion-api
From here you will be prompted to make an account and choose the free version.
Once your account has been made, please click the Live Demo button on the API screen
and you will be provided an API key. This key can then be updated at the top of the 
get_emotion function in the MarijuanaMain.py file. The API key present has 30 free
uses to test out before a new key is required.
